			<p><strong><i>A Journey of Hope</i></strong> was inspired by a fusion of experiences and ideas and became the foundation for Guardians of the Deep
			<a href="https://scientistinlimbo.com/2016/03/03/visitors-from-the-deep-the-tale-of-fish-and-hoek/"target="_blank">The story of Fish and Hoek,</a>        	
			&nbsptwo bottlenose dolphins frequenting the shores of False Bay in Cape Town during the summer of 1953, captured the imagination of a young Sally Sivewright 
			and fuelled her fascination and love for the ocean.</p>				  
			
			This passion for the ocean and her determination to see it protected has led her on many adventures, most recently landing her in Plettenberg Bay 
			where she began assisting in fin profiling for the Garden Route Dolphin Research and Acoustic Monitoring Project.</p>			 
			 
			<p>As part of the project, the unique notch patterns of the bottlenose dolphin’s dorsal fin are identified and catalogued from a database of 
			photographs dating back to 1991. These notch patterns are so unique and relatively stable that they can be used to identify individual dolphins, 
			much like a fingerprint would identify a human.</p>	
			
			<p>While working through one of the catalogues and comparing over 75 500 photographs Sally noticed that one dolphin, who was first recorded as appearing
			in Plettenberg Bay on 19 May 1997, only appeared again in 2015 but astonishingly also on the 19th of May. She was intrigued by the fact
			that this animal, not seen for 18 years, was spotted again on the exact same day so many years later.</p>

		<div class="row__50">	 
			<p>She contacted the Project Co-ordinator, Alejandra Vargas, and they mused over where this dolphin could have been and what tales it could tell 
			of its time outside the Bay. Alejandra suggested that it would be a great idea for a children’s story and so to bring their ideas to life with her
			beautiful illustrations, Ronel Wheeler joined the crew. 
			
			Together the three women nurtured the tale of a little girls magical discovery of the power and abundance of the ocean into a <strong><i>Journey of Hope </i></strong>.
			At the same time, they would interweave the Adventures of George the Bottlenose Dolphin, using a charismatic species to highlight ocean health and the power of our choices.</p>		   
			<p>As the idea grew, so did their circle with Sheila, Paul and Mohini being welcomed to the wonky round table. Fuelled by hot soup and tea, meetings 
			would last well into the night as ideas were ignited and concepts were developed. <strong><i>A Journey of Hope</i></strong> now forms part of a much larger movement, one that has 
			the ability to grow and inspire generations to seek out the wonders of the ocean and as a result, be encouraged to protect it.”</p>
