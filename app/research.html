					This form of identification allows individual dolphins to be identified by unique patterns in naturally occurring marks on their dorsal fins. Long-lasting marks 
					(versus temporary markings) enables identification of individuals over long periods of time. These marks include fin deformities, unusual fin shapes and nicks in 
					the trailing edge and peduncle. The acquisition of dorsal fin nicks and other long-lasting marks in small cetaceans is cumulative, therefore animals with these marks 
					will tend to be the older individuals. Temporary markings include major and minor scratches, active and healed disease and white fin-fringe, which allow for 
					identification of animals over short periods.

				 Photographs from a catalogue taken at different dates were matched to investigate temporal patterns of individuals. The study assessed patterns in residency and seasonality 
				 of reccurring individuals in the bay - whether the same individuals were frequently sighted in the bay or not, and whether any seasonal patterns of individuals occurred.
				 
				 <p>A photographic database, containing approximately 100 000 photographs dating back to 1991 was used as a means to record the movement patterns of the bottlenose dolphins. 
				 Usable photographs were cropped, sorted and individuals identified to form a database of dolphins frequenting Plettenberg Bay. Sally joined Alejandra and 
				 the Garden Route Dolphin Research Project to assist with the cataloguing of the photographs. This project formed the basis of the conceptualisation of the Visitors from the Deep 
				 children’s book. In order to keep monitoring the individuals visiting Plettenberg Bay, Sally will keep the record up to date, comparing newly acquired photographs with the 
				 existing historical catalogue (1991-2016).</p>

				You can help Sally by learning to catalogue dolphins for inclusion. It's interesting stuff and you will be helping by expanding our knowledge and understanding of Dolphins. 
				Just like Sally and Visiors from the deep, you are likely to identify a dolphin friend and follow him on his visits!</p>

            <h3>Behavioural Effects of Swim-With-Seal Ecotourism within the Robberg MPA</h3>
            
            <h4>Lead Institutions: Department of Environmental Affairs, Nelson Mandela University, CapeNature</h4>            
                        
             Swim-with-seals ecotourism ventures are operating in two marine protected areas (MPAs) in South Africa; Robberg MPA in Plettenberg Bay and
             Table Mountain National Park MPA in Cape Town. Clients are afforded the opportunity to snorkel with Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) 
             in the animals’ natural environment and are able to observe their curious, and often hilarious, antics up close.If conducted responsibly, these ventures 
             have the potential to benefit socioeconomic and conservation efforts; reckless conduct however can put the seals at risk of harassment, injury and death. 
             In order to ensure the welfare of these animals, that they are not harassed or adversely affected in any way, the development of appropriate guidelines is required, 
             also promoting the sustainable conduct of the operators.<br><br>
              
             The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) is the institute accountable for the establishment of protocols and the governing of such activities. 
             Together with Nelson Mandela University (NMU) and CapeNature, they are working to understand the impact that these activities would have on the 
             behaviour and welfare of the colony.<br>
              
			In an effort to understand how the seals react to these activities, Sally is currently carrying out observations on the Cape fur seal colony 
			situated on the north side of the Robberg Peninsula. The aims of this study are to describe the swim-with-seal operations, investigate the short-term behavioural 
			effects of the seal colony, and provide scientific recommendations towards “sustainable industry practice” and effective regulation. The situation and topography
			of the Robberg Nature Reserve, high cliffs overlooking the colony and adjacent waters, facilitates observations and counts of the animals onshore, 
            in the shallows and further out to sea.<br /><br>
               
            While on the mountain, Sally is also observing the presence and behaviour of a vagrant southern elephant seal bull (Mirounga leonine) as it interacts with 
            the fur seals of the colony. This seal, known to locals as Solo, has been visiting the rocky shore of the Robberg Nature Reserve for several years; arriving 
            from one of the sub-Antarctic islands to haul-out and moult.</p><br />

		   <h3>Behaviour and Size of Great White Sharks utilising the Robberg MPA</h3>               
			The great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) that frequent the waters of Plettenberg Bay are of great interest to Sally and as such she is recording the presence,
			behaviour and size of the individuals swimming past the Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) colony. The high cliffs provide a good vantage point from which 
			to observe the sharks in the clear, shallow water. Great white sharks are apex predators and play a key role in maintaining healthy oceanic ecosystems. A protected species
			 in South African waters since 1991, these sharks are recorded as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and as such every effort should 
			 be made to ensure their survival. While seasonality is expected around the seal colony, an increase in white sharks in response to seal pup presence in the water, 
			 it will be interesting to record whether or not there is a seasonality of the size of shark utilising the waters of Plettenberg Bay. Not much is known about the 
			 lives of great white sharks; where they are born and where the juveniles grow up has remained a relative mystery until recently when nurseries were found off the 
			 coast of California and Mexico. It is important to identify possible nursery areas so as to afford them protection in an effort to promote  the successful recruitment 
			 of juveniles and the overall survival of the species. The locations of where female white sharks give birth and how often they pup are key points to determine in 
			 ensuring the survivorship of this species. A number of juveniles (1-1.5 m) have been recorded in Plett and to know whether or not a nursery 
			is present in the region will be vital in the planning and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along our coastline.
			Inshore mobbing of these white sharks, by the fur seals, is an interesting behaviour trait often recorded at the Robberg seal colony and one that Sally wishes 
			to investigate further. Great white sharks are ambush predators with predations mostly taking place in deeper water, channels and along the fringes of kelp forests. 
			When in the clear, shallow water close to the mountain however, the seals are able to spot the sharks and chase them off.
