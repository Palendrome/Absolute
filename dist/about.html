        	Discovering and sharing the secrets of our natural world through exploration, observation and research. 
             Inspiring conservation through awareness and education to build a future of mutualistic co-existence.
             The ocean is the earth’s lifeblood; without healthy marine ecosystems, life on earth would cease to exist. 
             Our everyday choices empower us to become the change that is required to respect the delicate natural balance and to 
             acknowledge the importance of a healthy environment.</p>

				<p>Sally is a BSc graduate, with a double major in Zoology and Botany, from the Nelson Mandela University in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. 
				Sally spent a year in Scotland studying Marine Science at the Scottish Association for Marine Science and three years working through the Game Ranging and 
				Wildlife Management course while volunteering at a local private game reserve.<br /><br />
				
				Sally’s key focus is on conservation biology, animal behaviour and rehabilitation while her other interests include photography, adventures and dog sledding. 
				The rugged wilderness of South Africa and more specifically the ocean off Kommetjie, a small village on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula; provided a rich 
				backdrop growing up and allowed Sally to nurture her love for animals and the environment as a whole. <br /><br />
				
				“Conservation” and a “sustainable future” are more than just buzz words to Sally and as such she hopes to make an impact on how people perceive science and 
				the environment.</p>

			  <p>Began a career in sound engineering working for Rhodesia Television and the Department of Education.
				 Moved to Johannesburg in 1965 and was active in recording many of the programmes that made Springbok radio such a 
				 popular station in those days before television. Paul produced and presented "Sterns Hitmakers" during 
			   that time and recorded a "7 single" with the now famous South Africa producer, John "Mutt" Lange.</p>
				 
			  <p>Moving to Gallo Studios and music engineering provided the opportunity to record with Mimi Coertse, Joan and Louis Berk Theatre productions, 
				The Bats and Billy Forrest to name a few. Paul joined J.Walter Thompson advertising agency to run their multimedia facilities and worked with 
			  Barry Goldman on some ground breaking multi-screen productions for Siemens amongst others.</p>

			  <p>Sheila McCallister and Paul formed SP Studios in 1991, initially operating from the basement of Sandton City and later moving
				to our own studios in Hurlingham Office Park. We spent 15 happy years there providing video, audio and graphics 
				production and post-production services to advertising agencies and clients such as Porsche, IDC, SA Breweries, Red Cross, Unicef and Sappi. 
			  We found most reward in creating educational and informative videos that impart knowledge and training to the audience.</p>
