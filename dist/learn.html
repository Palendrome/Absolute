            <h2>Common Bottlenose Dolphin</h2>
             <!-- <div class="underline"></div>  -->
             <p>IUCN Status: Least Concern (LC)
             <h4>Distribution:</h4>
             <p>Worldwide, bottlenose dolphins occupy a wide range of coastal and pelagic habitats throughout tropical and temperate waters. In some regions, 
             despite no obvious boundaries to interchange, the inshore and offshore ecotypes differ genetically and morphologically. (Tezanos-Pinto et al. 2009). 
             The species occurring in the waters of Plettenberg Bay is a mix of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the common bottlenose dolphin 
             (Cockcroft et al. 1992). The Indo-Pacific bottlenose has a discontinuous distribution in the warm temperate to tropical Indo-Pacific, 
             from South Africa in the west to southeast Australia in the east, and generally occurs over shallow coastal waters on the continental 
             shelf or around oceanic islands (Wells & Scott 2002).</p>
             <h3>Diet and Feeding:</h3>
             <p>The diet of a bottlenose dolphin consists of a wide variety of schooling, demersal and reef, fishes and cephalopods (i.e.: squid, octopus and cuttlefish). 
             These dolphins use a variety of foraging techniques (solitary and cooperative) to detect and pursue prey with individuals developing specialised techniques 
             that have been shaped in response to their habitat type and prey resources (Weiss 2006). Due to the lengthy duration of the mother-calf bond, with suckling 
             lasting for approximately 18 months, the mother is able to pass on these specialisations to their calves (Weiss 2006). These site-specific feeding behaviours
             include mud-plume feeding and strand-feeding.</p>
             <p>Over shallow seagrass beds in the Florida Keys, a small group of bottlenose dolphins perform a cooperative feeding behaviour known as mud plume feeding. 
             A single dolphin will swim in a circle around a school of fish, swiftly moving its tail along the sand to create a plume of suspended sediment. This temporary 
             net acts to disorientate the fish and they begin jumping above the surface. The dolphins can then lunge through the plume, catching fish with relative ease (Lewis 2003).</p>
             <h3>Predators:</h3></p>
           	
             <p>Large shark species such as the bull, dusky, great white and tiger sharks are known to prey on bottlenose dolphins, especially calves. To minimise predation, 
             dolphins swim in pods as larger numbers increase the safety of the individual. In response to a predation event; these dolphins can defend themselves through mobbing techniques, 
             charging the predator, or complex evasive strategies to outswim the predator. Mobbing behaviour, which can either be forcing the predator to flee or mauling it, 
             has been recorded as occasionally ending with the death of the predator.</p>
             <h3>Threats:</h3>
             <p>Bottlenose dolphins are still killed for their meat or to eliminate them as competition for fish and are still captured for marine parks. These dolphins, 
             along with many other ocean species, get caught as bycatch in the fishing industries. Pollution, such as metal contaminants (cadmium and mercury) and microplastics, 
             is another major killer of all marine life, not just bottlenose dolphins. High heavy metal concentrations in dolphins have been associated with kidney malformations
             (Lavery et al. 2009).</p>
        
       
             <p>You can help conserve these dolphins (and other marine species) by only consuming fish from dolphin-friendly sources and fisheries listed as 
             Green on the WWF SASSI Fisheries List, by not using cosmetics that contain microbeads and by not using single-use plastic such as straws and take-away containers.</p>
		
             <h3>Conservation:</h3>
             <p>Bottlenose dolphins currently have the status of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

        <div class="learn__wrap--narrow">
			 Due to their abundance, their generalist habitat requirements 
             and their adaptability, the future of their species is deemed to be stable. Specific populations, such as the one in Scotland’s Moray Firth and an isolated population in 
             New Zealand’s Doubtful Sound, are however under threat. The Moray Firth population is estimated to consist of approximately 190 individuals that are under threat 
             from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and a reduction in food availability. The declaration of the site as a European Special Area of Conservation (SAC)
             in 1996 has acted to protect this population and while the threats are still present, the population is relatively stable (Cheney et al. 2012). 
             The Doubtful Sound population is in decline as a result of calf loss in response to tourism and habitat modification (Currey et al. 2009).</p>
